# React-express-news-app

React-Express-App is a simple news applicaiton which uses React and Material UI for the client side and Express and Node for server side. It utilizes NewsAPI (https://newsapi.org/) for the back-end part of the application.

## Installation

Before running the app on your localhost, create an account and API key at https://newsapi.org/. Next, head off to the root directory of the application and add `.env` file where you'll need to paste your API key. The environmental variable should be called `NEWS_API_KEY`.

```
.env
```
Run following commands.

1. `npm install`
2. `cd client && npm install`
3. `npm start`

`npm build` command is also available for the client and server side.

You should see that both client and server are running
